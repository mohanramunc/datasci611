#+TITLE: Git Zero to Hero
* About These Notes

Today's lecture really is a continuous narrative, so we're going to
follow along with my notes rather than use a slide deck.

* Git

1. The most commonly used version control system in the world.
2. Among the most powerful.
3. The most important tool you can learn in this class.

Git, when used properly, gives you total control over the history of
your work combined with excellent tools for collaboration. 

Stop thinking of your project as "this code". Your project is the git
repository.

Never name files or functions "v1" "v2" "v3" etc. Just let git manage
history and versions for you.

* Git Concepts

** diff and patch
[[./images/diff-patch.png]]

Clear our temporary directory.

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both
rm -rf /tmp/example
mkdir /tmp/example
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
#+end_src

Create two similar files.

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example :export both

cat << EOF > filev1.txt
This is a file I'm using as
an example for a presentation.
While git is the most common version control
system, it may not be the most powerful.

That distinction goes to Darcs.

That is, diff takes two files which are similar and returns a "patch"
which is a set of instructions for converting one file into another.

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example

diff -u filev1.txt filev2.txt > the-patch

#+end_src

Naturally the difference between `filev2-from-patch` and `filev2` is
the empty diff.

* The Big Idea

Your project is a chain of patches:

* `git status` and Three Things in your Head

[[./images/rule-of-three.png]]

1. The Branch HEAD
2. The Staging Area
3. The Working Copy

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
#+end_src

This is a little bit of a weird of a situation because we don't have
any commits at all (this only happens when you have a new repo).

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example

"git diff" tells us the difference between the working copy and the
branch HEAD (but not the differences which are staged).

  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
#+end_src

A readable description.

* Branches, Merges and Rebases

Branches have a HEAD. That is *almost* all a branch is, in the final
analysis. A HEAD and some code which automatically moves the HEAD
forward when you make a commit. Listing branches:

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git branch -l
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
,* main
#+end_src

Branches are *local* by default.

If you are working collaboratively with other people, feel free to
create as many local branches as you want. This is particularly useful
when you are getting started with git. If you are a little concerned
about something, create a branch before doing it.

There are two ways to create a new branch:

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git branch experiment
git status
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
#+end_src

Note that the above creates a new branch but DOESN'T SWITCH TO IT!!

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git checkout -b experiment2
git status
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
On branch experiment2
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
#+end_src

Note we've switched to the experiment2 branch. 

checkout (without -b) lets us check out other branches.

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git checkout main
git status
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
M	README.md
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git checkout experiment2
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
M	README.md
#+end_src

Note that we can switch branches even if the working copy has changes.

* Merge

Let's make a commit. 

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git add README.md
git commit -m "Extended README."
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
[experiment2 8734b22] Extended README.
 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
#+end_src

A simple merge:

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git checkout main
git merge experiment2
git log -2 | cat
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh

    Initial commit.
#+end_src

[[./images/basic-merge.png]]

This is a "fast forward" merge - we just add each commit from
experiment2 to main. Because experiment2 is based precisely on the
same commit that the main branch is still on, this is a trivial
operation.

* Conflicts and Rebase

Ther power of git is how it enables distributed development: two
people on different machines (or even one person on different machines
or just on different branches.)

The simplest conflict is that one branch has "moved ahead" while
another has done work based on a previous state.

For now, imagine we are working on an experiment on a new branch,
experiment3:

[[./images/merge-vs-rebase.png]]

We want to get the code represented by the orange commits. We could do
it by merge or by rebase.

The rebase is tidier and also more polite. It presumes that main is
the authoritative version of the code and thus it should be that your
experiment should look like it was made on the most recent version of
main possible.

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git checkout -b experiment3
git status
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
On branch experiment3
nothing to commit, working tree clean
#+end_src

A simple case where there are no textual conflicts.

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
cat << EOF > hello.md
Hi everyone!
EOF
git add hello.md
git commit -m "Added hello.md"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
[experiment3 6bfdce0] Added hello.md
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.md
#+end_src

Now let's make a commit on main without merging first. This
simulates main "moving on".

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git checkout main
cat << EOF > goodbye.md
So long, everyone.
EOF
git add goodbye.md
git commit -m "Added goodbye."
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
[main bf1f67f] Added goodbye.
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 goodbye.md
#+end_src

Now we check out experiment3 and do some experiments.

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git checkout experiment3
git checkout -b experiment3-merge
git merge main
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh

#+end_src

Note the absence of the merge. 

Most of the time code flows back into main - this is the "canonical"
version of the repository meant for things which are "really done."

The nice thing about rebase is that it allows us to do a trivial merge
of the feature branch into main - the feature branch now looks like
it was based on the most recent version.

#+end_src

A "fast forward" merge doesn't create a merge commit.

_Moral of the Story: Rebase when working on features. Save "merge" for
 genuine mergers of truly different histories._

* Resolving Conflicts

Conflicts occur when two commits touch the same line of code. Git can
tell you about them but it can't fix them for you. Let's simulate a
conflict.

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git checkout main
git checkout -b conflicts
cat << EOF > conflicts-here.md
This is a file
it has some lines
I hope nothing goes wrong!
Perhaps it will, though.
Best have a plan.
EOF

git add conflicts-here.md
git commit -m "Added a new file."
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
[conflicts 7fad9f0] Added a new file.
 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 conflicts-here.md
#+end_src

Now on main, let's create a conflict.

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git checkout main
cat << EOF > conflicts-here.md
This is a file
it has many lines
I hope nothing goes wrong!
Perhaps it will, though.
Best have a good plan.
EOF

git add conflicts-here.md
git commit -m "Added a conflict file."
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
[main 6e4471a] Added a conflict file.
 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 conflicts-here.md
#+end_src

We are good citizens, so we go to the conflicts branch and try to
rebase on main, which has moved ahead.

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git checkout conflicts
# we'd usually run this
# git rebase main
# but since we are capturing the output in this document 
# we need to be a litte tricky
git rebase main > rebase-report
cat rebase-report
rm rebase-report
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
Auto-merging conflicts-here.md
CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in conflicts-here.md
#+end_src

To resolve this we need to look at the file:

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
cat conflicts-here.md
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
This is a file
<<<<<<< HEAD
it has many lines
I hope nothing goes wrong!
Perhaps it will, though.
Best have a good plan.
=======
it has some lines
I hope nothing goes wrong!
Perhaps it will, though.
Best have a plan.
>>>>>>> 7fad9f0 (Added a new file.)
#+end_src

Note that git has fused these files together and it expects us to edit
it until we have the version we want.

Let's assume our version is actually better, so we keep just the
bottom part:

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
cat << EOF > conflicts-here.md
it has some lines
I hope nothing goes wrong!
Perhaps it will, though.
Best have a plan.
EOF
git add conflicts-here.md
git rebase --continue 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
#+end_src

And that should finish the merge:

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git log -3
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh

    Added goodbye.
#+end_src

* git commit ammend

Sometimes we want to modify the last commit. This is ok as long as we
haven't pushed yet. 

In this case the commit message is now a little weird - its better to
say we modified the file introduced by main.

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git commit --amend -m "Modified the conflicting file."
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
[detached HEAD 95f2216] Modified the conflicting file.
 Date: Mon Sep 19 18:33:05 2022 +0000
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 conflicts-here.md
#+end_src

Now we just need to merge our conflicts branch onto main:

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git checkout main 
git merge conflicts
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
#+end_src

* Remotes

Git is distributed version control. Everyone who has a git repository
is in principle working alone.

`remotes` are the way git allows collaboration. Remotes have names
which point to locations. By far the most common name for a remote is
`origin` and that remote often points to github, though there are
other services (bitbucket, gitlab). A remote can even be another
directory on your computer.

You list your remotes by saying:

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git remote -v
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
#+end_src

But we don't have any. We all created our git repositories locally
first and then associated them with a remote on github by saying something like 

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
# git remote add origin <some-url-at-github>
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
#+end_src

But its much more ordinary to have a remote configured for you via a
clone:

(Clear any previous workspaces)

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
rm -rf /tmp/workspace
mkdir /tmp/workspace
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
#+end_src

And in that directory:

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/workspace
git clone git@github.com:Vincent-Toups/bios611-project1.git
cd bios611-project1
git remote -v
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
origin	git@github.com:Vincent-Toups/bios611-project1.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:Vincent-Toups/bios611-project1.git (push)
#+end_src

Note that you may also clone from an `https` link. This specifies the
way you intend to interact with the remote repository. Either is fine,
but if you are using ssh keys it probably will be a `git@` style url.

You can generally ignore this business of `fetch` and `push` remotes.

* Remotes and Branches

Usually you are trying to keep synchronized with a remote branch that
someone else might be working on.

When you clone a repo for the first time it automatically sets up
associations between the local branches and the branches on the remote
you cloned from.

Thus commands like `git push`, `git pull` and `git fetch` know what
branch to look for on the remote.

* Don't pull

You should understand `git pull` as meaning strictly "I am behind the
remote and I've done nothing at all locally and I just want to get the
latest commits."

In any other situation you want to do the following:

* the fetch/rebase pattern

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
git fetch # grab the remote commits but don't change local branches
git rebase origin/main # rebase main on origin main
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
#+end_src

* Interactive Staging And Small Commits

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
# git add -i # I have to demo this
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
#+end_src

The idea is to add _pieces_ of files to the staging area. This allows
very granular commits even if you let the working copy get pretty
messy.

* Forks and Pull Requests

You are unlikely to need to do this in this class, but you are likely
to have to do it at some point.

Conceptually, every `git clone` produces a fork. But on github and
other places there is a more formal idea.

[[./images/fork.png]]

This clones the repo to your account. You can then clone it onto your
computer and work on it. If you do work you think you might want to
contribute back you should then do a pull request via github.

But before you do that you would need to rebase your main branch on
the original repository (this is the polite thing to do in most
cases).

This is a good way to see when you might have more than one remote.

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/example
cd /tmp
rm -rf puff 
git clone git@github.com:Vincent-Toups/puff.git
cd puff
git remote -v 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
origin	git@github.com:Vincent-Toups/puff.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:Vincent-Toups/puff.git (push)
#+end_src

Note that I've only got remotes for my copy of the repo.

I can add a second remote for the "upstream" version of the project
(that is, the place I cloned from).

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both :dir /tmp/puff
git remote add upstream git@github.com:VincentToups/puff.git 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
#+end_src

And then to rebase I'd say:

#+begin_src sh :results code :exports both
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main 
git push # up to my CSCC account.
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sh
#+end_src

And then I'd make a pull request.
